# Prologue

Sunsets always seem to me to last for such a long time. The happiest moments of my life have come when I've been watching them, as I do now. For a moment I wonder if this says something about me.

The sun finally gives way to sepia sky. “I'm leaving,” she says. 

And that's it. 


# One

All my life I dreamed of something different. 

When I was eleven, a trickster convinced me that I could see shapes in clouds and control them; Science became an hour, four times a week, in which I was a warrior whose destiny it was to save the world from some unspecified yet unspeakable evil — which could be vanquished by masses of liquid droplets. I said I've always dreamed; not always realistically. 

At this point I'm tempted to talk about the rain. It foreshadows my story, and as a subject it's evocative. Truth is, I should be more focused on the cops. Maybe you should be, too. 

Three heavy knocks.

“Yovi Cherry. Please put down your weapons and step into the hallway.”

I grab my gear and climb out the window. If I descend the fire escape I run into more cops — but that's not the plan. I go up. I get on the roof, and the rain saturates my hair in seconds, so I afford myself a moment to lament my lack of cloud-controlling ability with a heavy sense of irony. Peripherally, I hear a loud crash and a heavy fall. Presumably it's a door to an apartment full of memories but emptied of secrets. I don't intend to stick around long enough for the aftermath. 

Static crackles in my ear. “Yovi, you ready? It's not too late; you can just give yourself up; you can explain the situation to them; we could get you out”. 

My partner breathes semi-colons. I plug the stim into my inner elbow. “I'm ready to jack, Dennis. Push it”. 

“I could have gotten you out, Yovi, man …” 

Then an altogether more organic voice screams “FREEZE!” behind me, and others start shouting about getting down on the ground with my hands up. 

It has to be now. 

I barely have time to curse Dennis before my consciousness begins its familiar descent into virtual reality. I like to think the optical feedback at this point mirrors the brain's hopelessness; that it's like looking into a broken kaleidoscope. 

But really, it's just a stylised loading screen. Custom. 

I am in the Metaverse. 

Back on the roof in London, my body crumples and Metropolitan Police swarm around it. I assume. 

I start to walk forwards.
